Board game for children

## How to play

Each player has three pawns of the same color.

The game takes place in two stages :

1. Each player successively rolls the dice and moves the drop of the given
   number along the red pawns, then place one of his pawns with the star up
   around the red pawn.
2. When all the pawns have been set, turn the light off and, in the same
   order, each player reverses a pawn of his choice.
   When there is one pawn left, turn the light on. The winner is the player
   of this color.
